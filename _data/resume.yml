  summary: |
    For the greater community, I help companies realise the world of adaptivity by making ubiquitous computing as natural as breathing.

    Empowering organizations to optimize Speed, Scale & Margin via foggy cloud structures and innovation with Zero Impact to production systems.

    -  [ Speed ] 1 Week @ NTT Data (Japan) eliminated 4 months of overtime commitment per year
    -  [ Scale ] 3 months @ Maestro Interactive (USA) 10x improvement in simultaneous interactive live video streams to >1million streams
    -  [ Margin ] 6 Months @ Vodafone Hutchinson (Australia) direct saving of $1.6 million over 3 years.

    Combining the strategic approaches above with a plethora of IT knowledge, I am regularly invited to speak at events such as: CeBit (Australia), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Brisbane, HackerX (Brisbane), Venture Summit (USA), Chief Data & Analytics Officer (Melbourne), TechCrunch (USA) & various Engineering Meetups

    Ranked at TechCrunch USA 2018 as one of the World’s Top 10 in Containerization for authoring of Cyvive (Operational & Governance Platform for Kubernetes) and implementing a Configuration & Continuous Delivery Meta Language (Foggy Ubiquity's Language) via collaboration with 3 Universities & 35 Industry Publications as a way to address the looming complexity challenge of DevSecOps.

    Available for contracting, consulting, speaking engagements such as keynotes, panel discussions, roundtables and workshop sessions.
