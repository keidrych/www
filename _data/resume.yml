  summary: |
    i, believe we use what we trust, and trusted technology serves mankind; a 5% increase of internet (cyberspace) trust results in $3000+ increase of GDP per capita.\
    i, state that real Planet Scale or Foggy (Cloud -> Fog -> Edge -> Mist(IoT/IoP)) computing is ubiquitous, teitering on sentience and critical in building credibility and trustworthyness between organisations and customers.\
    i, created the philiosothy of Cyvive: Scorched Earth because i, saw numerous examples of unreliable Information Technology (IT) crafted with good intention yet unequipped to operate beyond a single data center, region or cloud provider; i, discovered without reliable Planet Scale Foggy Computing it is impossible to secure credibility, foster intimacy, or reduce customers worry long term.\
    \
    i, typically guide organisations through the quagmire of multi/poly Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) technologies so their technological foundation may be secure to all, reliable for customers, and moneterily efficiently through leveraging Scorched Earth capabilities towards zero production impact on Plant Scale Architecture.\
    i, have helped companies in Asia, Europe, USA, Oceania.\
    \
    i, have been invited to speak at events such as; CeBit (Australia), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Brisbane, HackerX (Brisbane), Venture Summit (USA), TechCrunch (USA) & various Engineering Meetups & technology enthusiast groups
