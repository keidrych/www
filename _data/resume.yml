  summary: |
    I reconcile technology to mankind through helping organisations Cyvive Foggy Computing by making planet scale ubiquitous computing as natural as breathing.
    I push the limits of cyber adaptivity by leveraging scorched earth capabilities to advance technological maturity; enhance security and gravitate towards zero impact on production systems.

    - Author of Containizen; max security, minimal footprint production base containers. Containizen preserved for future generations as it was selected to be included in the Artic Code Vault where the code was placed on hardened film to survive 1000 years.
    - Innovator of Cyvizen (Cyber Survival Denizen); equilibrium between Anonyminity and Privacy while ensuring the ability to Scorched Earth Hardware. (Lost, Stolen, Damaged). Cyvizen is in use by Government, IT Professionals, Perpetual Travellers.
    - Ranked at TechCrunch USA 2018 as one of the Worldâ€™s Top 10 in Containerization for 1) authoring an Operational & Governance Platform for Kubernetes, and 2) implementing a Configuration & Continuous Delivery Meta Language (Fathomable) via collaboration with 3 Universities & 35 Industry Publications.
    - Founded & Sold a Cloud Native Research & Development company: Sotekton owner of Fathomable some of its technology was featured on Channel 10, Eleven and One

    I have been invited to speak at events such as; CeBit (Australia), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Brisbane, HackerX (Brisbane), Venture Summit (USA), TechCrunch (USA) & various Engineering Meetups
